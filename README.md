# WIP - deep-runner

Using deep learning to analyzing your **CSV** data from spreadsheets or other sources needen't require you to know how to write
code. *deep-runner* is a utility that lets you train or run deep-learning networks using a simple declaritive format usng the
[DeepLearning4J](https://deeplearning4j.org/) framework. Several examples have been adapted from the deeplearning4j examples
are provided in `contrib/deeplearning4j` to get you started.

## Using deep-runner

* --data input-file
* --out output-file
* --in-model deep-runner-model
* --out-model

## Setting up deep-runner learning

*deep-runner* uses **YAML** syntax to define your learning networks. **YAML** is simple to learn and use, supporting individual
settings lists and hierarchies, so its got everything needed to setup and train a deep learning network. You can find more
information on **YAML** [here](http://www.yaml.org/start.html)
